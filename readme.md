# About

tomdn.com (or ToMDN.com or TomDn.com) makes web documentation quicker to access than the old way of googling `mdn array some`.

## What is this?

This project is inspired by php.net (stay with me). php.net nailed the user experience of finding documentation for a function. `php.net/[function_name]` takes you right to the official documentation for [`function_name`]. It's a small thing, but it's one of my favorite features of PHP.

MDN is the defacto documentation for the web, but getting to the desired information is not as easy. tomdn.com site exists to make the experience more like php.net.

## Where is this?
